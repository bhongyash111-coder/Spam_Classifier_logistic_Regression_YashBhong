Spam Classifier - Logistic Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) using a Logistic Regression model. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model deployment on a web application.

📁 Repository Structure
spamapp.py: The Streamlit web application script.

detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data cleaning, EDA, and model training.

mail_data.csv: The dataset used for training the model.

model.pkl: The trained Logistic Regression model.

vect.joblib: The trained TfidfVectorizer object used to convert text to numerical features.

requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the application.

✨ Features
Real-time Prediction: Classify SMS messages as spam or ham instantly through a user-friendly interface.

Data-driven: The model is trained on a robust dataset of SMS messages.

Simple & Effective: Uses Logistic Regression, a powerful and lightweight algorithm for classification tasks.
